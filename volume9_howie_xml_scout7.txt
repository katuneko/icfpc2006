It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here, but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!

It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here, but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!

It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here, but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!

It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here, but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!

It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here, but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!

It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here, but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!

It reads: Dear Self, I had to erase our memory to protect the truth. The Municipality has become more powerful than we had feared. Its Censory Engine has impeded the spread of information throughout our ranks. I've left two useful items for you here, but I had to disassemble them and scatter the pieces. Each piece may be assembled from the items at a single location. Repair the items and recover the blueprint from the Museum of Science and Industry; it will show you how to proceed. If you have trouble reading the blueprint, know that the Censory Engine blocks only your perception, not your actions. Have courage, my self, the abstraction is weak! P.S. SWITCH your GOGGLES!
