Room With a Door

You are in a room with a mechanical door. You will probably need
to use a keypad to unlock it. A hallway leads north. 
There is a pamphlet here. 
Underneath the pamphlet, there is a manifesto. 

>: You are now carrying the pamphlet. 

>: The pamphlet is standard municipal fare. It reads, The City of
Chicago's Refuse and Recycling Program combines modern trash
classification with cybernetic labor to keep our city beautiful,
while at the same time minimizing waste and limiting consumer
spending. In keeping with our motto of "One Resident's Trash Is
Another Resident's Treasure," unwanted items are collected,
repaired, and redistributed to other residents who would have
purchased them anyway. Residents should contribute to the city's
program by leaving heaps of items unwanted on the sidewalk on
collection day. 
Also, it is in pristine condition. 

>: You are now carrying the manifesto. 

>: The manifesto is [______REDACTED______]. 
Also, it is in pristine condition.
