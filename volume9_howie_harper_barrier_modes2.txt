You are in a machine room behind the rotunda. A secret passage

There is a crowbar here. 
Underneath the crowbar, there is a sticky note. 
Underneath the note, there is a console. 
Underneath the console, there is a Censory Engine.

Also, it is in pristine condition. 

>: The Censory Engine is making loud humming and whirring noises. 
Also, it is in pristine condition. 

>: There is no manifesto here. 

>: The proof is long and complicated, purporting to prove the
correctness of the Censory Engine. You have the feeling
something is wrong with it, but you keep getting lost in the
details. Too bad it's not in machine-checkable form. 
Also, it is in pristine condition.

Brandishing your crowbar with gusto, you smash the Censory
Engine, ending the Municipality's control over the flow of
information! Your vision clears noticeably.

>: Machine Room M4

You are in a machine room behind the rotunda. A secret passage
leads to the north. 
There is a (broken) Censory Engine here. 

>: The console is running UMIX, the operating system of choice for
sandstone computers. Using it, someone has been reading his
mail. The console reads:

From: snodgrass@cbv.net
To: pillinbrew@cbv.net
Subject: My paper

I completely disagree with the second referee's remarks! His
claims that my Censory Engine can be defeated using imperative
operations are completely untrue. As you can see in my article
(I am including it as an attachment for your reference), the
system is javelin-proof. If the referee is having difficulty
understanding my proof, that merely proves the superiority of my
ideas!

Subject: Adventure game

I'm glad you enjoyed the adventure game. Yes, I am hard at work
on the sequel, but I haven't gotten very far. There isn't much
story yet, but I do have several of the puzzles done. You're
more than welcome to try them if you like; you can add to your
score that way.  To play the sequel, just run adventure with the
"sequent-sequel" option.
