Room With a Door

You are in a room with a mechanical door. You will probably need
to use a keypad to unlock it. A hallway leads north. 
There is a pamphlet here. 
Underneath the pamphlet, there is a manifesto. 

>: Salon E

You are in Salon E of the Oregon Ballroom. A door leads east. 
There is a bullet-point here. 
Underneath the bullet-point, there is a (broken) slides.ppt. 

>: Salon E

You are in Salon E of the Oregon Ballroom. A door leads east. 
There is a bullet-point here. 
Underneath the bullet-point, there is a (broken) slides.ppt. 

>: The bullet-point is the kind of terse phrase you'd find in a
talk. 
Also, it is in pristine condition. 

>: The slides.ppt is part of a talk. It contains only one slide,
which reads:

	* Goal of game: build uploader, downloader

	* Abstract adventure game (items as propositions)

	* Solve by theorem proving

	* Try switching your goggles!

The presentation could use some more color. 
Also, it is broken: it is a slides.ppt missing a bullet-point.

exactly how.
